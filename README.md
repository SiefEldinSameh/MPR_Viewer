<img src="./assets/logo.png" alt="Project Logo" width="150px">

This project is a cutting-edge medical imaging application designed to assist professionals and researchers in visualizing and analyzing medical data. It provides advanced tools for viewing imaging data in axial, sagittal, coronal, and 3D formats. The application's intuitive user interface and robust functionality ensure efficient workflows and accurate insights.

## Overview

The **Enhanced Multi-View Medical Image Viewer** is built to streamline medical imaging tasks. With seamless support for DICOM and NIFTI file formats, it caters to radiologists, researchers, and healthcare professionals. The application features:

- **Multi-View Modes**: Visualize medical images across multiple planes and in 3D.
- **Advanced Navigation**: Crosshair-based interaction allows precise navigation through voxel data.
- **Customizable Display**: Brightness and contrast controls optimize image visibility.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use tools and a responsive layout simplify complex operations.

## Features

### 1. Multi-View Display
- **Axial, Sagittal, Coronal Views**: Provides detailed slice-by-slice analysis in three orthogonal planes.
- **3D Rendering**: Offers volumetric visualization to explore structures comprehensively.

### 2. File Format Support
- **DICOM**: Load entire directories of DICOM files.
- **NIFTI**: Supports .nii and .nii.gz files for advanced neuroimaging studies.

### 3. Crosshair Navigation
- Dynamic crosshair synchronization across views for precise voxel location.
- Real-time updates ensure consistent alignment between different planes.

### 4. Brightness and Contrast Adjustment
- Adjust gamma and scaling to enhance visualization of critical areas.
- Changes are applied in real-time for immediate feedback.
